## What is Alienchain

Alienchain is an experimental high-performance blockchain platform that powers decentralized application. It's written purely in Java and powered by BFT consensus algorithm.


## What are the characteristics of Alienchain?

High-performance Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus block chain. Alienchain confirms a transaction every 30 seconds, one is irreversible; each block can carry out 5000 transactions, which is a good solution to the problem of block congestion. Aliencoin uses validator to validate the reward model, which promotes the construction of community nodes.


## Alienchain Total Amount and Distribution Model

Alienchain has a total of 10 billion yuan and no additional issuance. 5 billion pioneers were mined and 5 billion were used as validator incentives (validator incentives for 1000 Alienchain blocks).


## Use of Alienchain

Alienchain integrates independent VM virtual machines, which can be used by developers to develop de-centralized applications in Java language.
